Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

## Personal Introduction

I am a student in my second year of studying IOT engineering at JCU.

## Lessons i've learnt on clean code

* The variable names must be appropriate and descriptive to what is being stored
* Variable names should follow proper and consistent naming conventions
