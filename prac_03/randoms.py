# print(random.randint(5, 20))  # line 1
# What did you see on line 1?
# What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?

# Answer: The smallest number possible was 5, the largest number was 20

# What did you see on line 2?
# What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
# Could line 2 have produced a 4?

# Answer:The smallest number possible was 3, the largest number was 9, line 2 cannot produce a 4

# What did you see on line 3?
# What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?

# Answer: The smallest number possible was 2.5, the largest number was 5.5
