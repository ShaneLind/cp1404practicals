## Practical Estimations
When predicting the length a task would take my estimations were always less than the time it actually took.
This was consistently due to getting stuck at certain areas that drastically increased the time till ocmpletion.
My estimations get more accurate as I began to inlcude the time for problem solving into the task completion estimate.

## Code Reviews
Being reviewed has helped to improve the effectiveness of my code.
The people reviewing my code were helpful in pointing out places where a better method could have been used.
[Practical 07 Feedback Pull Request.](https://github.com/ShaneLind/cp1404practicals/pull/4)
Reviewing people's code has helped me to find better ways of coding and has acted as a guide fo improving my own coding mehtods.
[Practical 09 Code Review.](https://github.com/sachhm/cp1404practicals/pull/8/files)
Helping to correct other people's code has also helped me further analyse my own thinking and method when coding.

## Practical Tasks
The practical tasks were an effective way to learn new python skills.
Each individual task focused mainly on learning a new skill or aplication of, which resulted in a sense of satisfaction with both learning a new skill and completing a task.
This motivated me in continuing to complete the next task.
A way to improve the practical tasks would be to include some form of example output for each task.
This will prevent any confusion in regards to what the task requires and will motivate the student to have a finished goal to aim for.
